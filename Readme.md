# About

**Developed** a basic React Form Validation Application.
I have completed a React course From the CodeAcademy platform 
to brush up my React skills and to get more hands on knowledge
by practising and learning the skills. Now, i can say that I have good knowledge of functional and class components. Also, more clarity in using **React Hooks**.
